### Planning Story
Given four days initially, I planned for the first two to be mainly focused on the back-end and the devlopment of my API, so the work during these days was limited. But I planned to have the basic HTML for the user sign-in, sign-up, sign-out, and change password done. Due to constant interruptions to the development flow of the back-end, I ended up with the HTML for both the user forms and the character resource forms finished with some basic styling by the end of this period. I was satisfied with the state of the front-end at this point so I discarded my plan to use the next two days on mainly the front-end and returned to developing the back-end. By the third day, the locally hosted client and API were communicating, and the user sign-in/up/out and change password actions were working. On the fourth day, I deployed the client to Github Pages, and the API to Heroku to iron out any issues that arose between the deployments.

#### User Stories
- As a user, I would like to be able to log in with a unique username and a password.
- As a signed-in user, I want to be able to create a character.
- As a signed-in user, I want to be able to see my existing characters.
- As a signed-in user, I would like to be able to update/change my existing characters.
- As a user, I would like to be able to change my password.
- As a user, I want to be able to log out.

#### Technologies Used
- Javascript
- HTML
- Sass (CSS)
- Bootstrap
- jQuery

#### Unsolved Problems
- I would like to make a modal to display the users character index.
- I want to format the authentication and character forms to sit next to eachother on the screen rather than stack vertically.
- I would like to have the action response messages disappear after 3-5 seconds.
